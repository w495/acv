Level Library Overview 
======================

.. note::
  This is work in progress

This page is an overview of qooxdoo's low-level capabilities. It does collect the existing documentation and tries to show the big picture.


CSS Selector Support 
---------------------

If you are familiar with jQuery you can check out the :doc:`comparison article <fromjquery>` of qooxdoo's `Collection class <http://demo.qooxdoo.org/%{version}/apiviewer/#qx.bom.Collection>`__ and jQuery implementation.


Scenarios 
---------

Depending on your needs you can either use a pre-build low-level library or use a low-level application class.
